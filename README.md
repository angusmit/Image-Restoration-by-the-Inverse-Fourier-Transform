This little project is motivated by my university course Facets of Mathematics, which discussed some fundamental techniques related to image processing. Hence, I would like to discover some advanced image processing techniques. In particular, Inverse Fourier Transform has been widely discussed for image restoration recently and I would like to discuss more about Inverse Fourier Transform in this little project.

In this little project, we would first introduce the theoretical elaboration for the Inverse Fourier Transform in terms of image restoration and processing. Then, we would introduce the generalizations and some of the real-life applications using Python to explain how Fourier Transform and its inverse works in real life in terms of image processing. Next, we would state disadvantages of Fourier Transform.
